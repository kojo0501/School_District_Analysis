# School District Analysis

## Purpose

### Analyzing School District Data
Maria was seeking to analyze performance trends and patterns using standardized test score data. The data is used to evaluate school performance and inform decisions about school funding. The data for individual students needed to be aggregated in a way that masks the identity of individual students. Analysis of the data was completed using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

### Removal of Thomas High School from Data Set
A signficant change from the original data set is that test scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School were removed the analysis. The data was removed at the request of the schoolboard due to evidence of academic dishonesty. The focus of this report is to compare analysis of the full data set to an analysis of a version that does not include Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math scores.
